## Summary
For our team’s CS415 final project, we plan on building a first person horror game called [unknown] where the player’s goal is to make it through the level alive, defeating enemies and collecting collectables along the way. The player will have the ability to walk, run, jump, and crouch. The combat system will include melee and ranged combat and attributes such as health, stamina, etc. There will be an emphasis on audio, lighting, UI in a way that adds to the horror genre. Victory will be achieved after the player successfully traverses the level and defeats the final boss.
